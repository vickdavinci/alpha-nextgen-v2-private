# Options Engine Master Audit (Single Source of Truth)

**Purpose:** Central, continuously updated bug registry and audit history for the Options Engine (Micro + VASS).  
**Rule:** All fixes and validations must be recorded here before/after backtests.

## Backtest Success Criteria (Use Before Reading Bug Summary)

**Principle:** Net P&L alone is not an acceptance test. Evaluate in order:  
**Technical Safety -> Execution Integrity -> Strategy Behavior -> Regime Fit -> P&L**

| ID | Gate | Success Criteria | Threshold / Rule | Status |
|:--:|------|------------------|------------------|:------:|
| SC-01 | Technical Safety | Runtime stability | No crash that halts trading loop | ⬜ |
| SC-02 | Technical Safety | No position amplification | Forced close never increases net position | ⬜ |

| T-20 | Technical | Spread candidate pre-filter drops zero-bid long legs | `main.py:3872` rejects when `bid<=0 or ask<=0` before leg-role assignment | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | Prefilter now rejects only invalid ask; zero-bid candidates are retained with safe mid-price fallback |
| T-21 | Technical | Credit selector missing liquidity quality filters | `options_engine.py:2974+` credit path lacks explicit OI/spread quality gates | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | Added OI/spread quality filters and diagnostics parity for credit short/long leg selection |

| T-28 | Technical | Intraday approved->execution drop remains severe | Stage6.17: `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_APPROVED=352`, `INTRADAY_SIGNAL=64`, `DROPPED=288` (81.8% drop) | 🔴 Reopened | Existing fallback coding still collapses to generic `DROP_ENGINE_NO_SIGNAL` in backtest |
| T-29 | Technical | VASS spreads are instantly closed by assignment guard | Stage6.14: `SPREAD: POSITION_REGISTERED=23`, `ASSIGNMENT_RISK_EXIT=23`, `POSITION_REMOVED=23` (<=1 min) | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | Assignment grace (`SPREAD_ASSIGNMENT_GRACE_MINUTES`) added before non-mandatory assignment exits |
| T-30 | Technical | NEUTRAL conviction veto can overtrade noisy flips | Panic rebound windows showed repeated NEUTRAL veto direction swings | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | NEUTRAL veto now requires MICRO tradeable regime + direction alignment with MICRO recommendation |
| T-31 | Technical | PRE_MARKET_SETUP callback still receives option symbol objects | V6.15 2015 run: `symbol must be a non-empty string` on 2015-08-26 / 2015-08-27 / 2015-09-03 | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | V6.16: premarket and ITM-short paths normalize symbols before router submission |
| T-32 | Technical | Intraday force-exit fallback close-side regression | V6.15 2015 run: `INTRADAY_FORCE_EXIT_FALLBACK` followed by `ROUTER: MARKET_ORDER | BUY ... Tag=MICRO` during close intent | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | V6.16: router close intents now derive side/qty from live holdings only (reduce-only behavior) |
| T-33 | Technical | Approved->dropped reason opacity in intraday path | V6.17: 288 drops all generic `DROP_ENGINE_NO_SIGNAL` with no engine reject code detail | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | V6.18 patch adds explicit intraday engine validation codes and detail propagation into drop log |
| T-34 | Technical | Force-close path not idempotent (position amplification) | V6.15 2017 run: 2017-08-22 close cycle grew to `Qty=653` via repeated fallback/OCO recovery before next-day reconcile | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | V6.16: close-in-progress lock + one-submit-per-symbol/day + live-qty override |
| T-35 | Technical | OCO recovery recreates oversized orders during force-close window | V6.15 2017 run: `OCO_RECOVER` created `Qty=431` while active intraday leg was `Qty=222` near 15:25 | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | V6.16: OCO recovery disabled near force-close window and skipped during close-in-progress |
| T-36 | Technical | Backtest telemetry suppresses intraday rejection reasons | CALL/PUT gate and intraday validation logs absent in stage6.17 despite high drop volume | 🔴 Open | `options_engine.log(..., trades_only=False)` suppression in backtest hides RCA signals; promote rejection logs/codes to backtest-visible path |
| O-01 | Optimization | Low win rate / negative P&L | 2022Q1: -21,641 | 🔴 Open | Strategy tuning |
| O-02 | Optimization | High Dir=NONE | 2022Q1: 59% | 🔴 Open | Micro gating still strict |
| O-03 | Optimization | Micro gating too restrictive | CAUTIOUS/NORMAL/WORSENING blocks | 🔴 Open | Expand tradeable regimes or thresholds |
| O-04 | Optimization | VASS rejection storm | 2022Q1: 534 rejections | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | DTE fallback + credit fix |
| O-05 | Optimization | CALL/PUT profitability imbalance | 2022Q1: PUTs worse | 🔴 Open | Strategy calibration |
| O-06 | Optimization | Multi-day hold efficiency | V6.13_a: 51/140 trades held >1 day | 🟡 Monitor | Most are swing by design; optimize carry/expiry behavior |
| O-07 | Optimization | PUT strategy underperforms in crash | 2015/2022 PUT P&L negative | 🔴 Open | Re‑evaluate PUT sizing/strategy |
| O-08 | Optimization | VASS as intraday governor | VASS inactive → micro dominates | 🔴 Open | Consider gating micro by VASS |

| O-10 | Optimization | Monthly P&L tracking | Aug 2015 drawdown visibility missing | ✅ Implemented | V6.12: MonthlyPnLTracker class + main.py integration |
| O-11 | Optimization | Position concentration limit | Multiple spreads same expiry | 🔴 Open | Add per‑expiry cap |
| O-12 | Optimization | CALL loss concentration remains dominant | Stage6.14: CALL P&L -20,695 vs PUT P&L +351 | 🟡 Applied (Pending Validation) | Added stress CALL block (`INTRADAY_CALL_BLOCK_VIX_MIN`, `INTRADAY_CALL_BLOCK_REGIME_MAX`) |
| O-13 | Optimization | PUT spread participation blocked by assignment guard strictness | V6.15 2015 run: `ValidationFail=BEAR_PUT_ASSIGNMENT_GATE` 124 rejections; put-direction rejections dominate (299/355) | 🔴 Open | Recalibrate assignment gate thresholds for bear-put debit construction |
| O-14 | Optimization | Micro participation still bottlenecked by gating | V6.15 2015 run: `Dir=NONE 72.6%`, `NO_TRADE` top blocks `REGIME_NOT_TRADEABLE/CONFIRMATION_FAIL/QQQ_FLAT` | 🔴 Open | Small-threshold tuning only; avoid broad logic expansion |
| O-15 | Optimization | PUT participation remains too low in bull/chop windows | V6.15 2017 run: PUT only 3/38 trades; VASS PUT attempts mostly blocked by assignment gate in low IV | 🔴 Open | Keep bear-put path available with risk-scaled sizing instead of hard gate in low-risk contexts |
| O-16 | Optimization | VASS conviction override too sensitive in RISK_ON | V6.17 2015 NoSync: bearish VIX-veto overrides during bullish macro windows (e.g., Jul 09/Jul 28) both lost | 🔴 Open | Add regime-aware hysteresis for VIX-veto so transient spikes do not force bearish spread direction in sustained risk-on |
| O-17 | Optimization | Counter-trend PUT entries during sustained RISK_ON degrade Micro expectancy | V6.17 2017 NoSync: PUTs in regime 73-75 had weak outcomes vs CALLs | 🔴 Open | Add trend-persistence gate for counter-trend intraday PUTs when macro remains strongly risk-on |
| O-18 | Optimization | Late-day intraday entries show weak/unstable edge | V6.17 2017 NoSync: multiple entries at/after 15:00 with mixed quality and elevated noise | 🔴 Open | Tighten late-session entry quality rules (higher conviction or reduced size near close) |
| O-19 | Optimization | Neutrality churn exits reduce spread efficiency | V6.17 analysis: repeated neutrality/dead-zone exits with fee drag and low-quality churn | 🔴 Open | Convert hard neutrality exits to staged de-risking (size-down/guarded hold) when risk is contained |

- `Dir=NONE`: **1,335** (**72.6%**)
- `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_APPROVED`: **173**
- `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_DROPPED`: **35**

  - `VIX_STABLE_LOW_CONVICTION`: **43**

### VASS Behavior

- `SPREAD: ENTRY_SIGNAL`: **27**
- `VASS_REJECTION`: **355**
- Rejection direction split: **PUT 299**, **CALL 56**
- Validation fails:
  - `DIRECTION_MISSING`: **205**
  - `BEAR_PUT_ASSIGNMENT_GATE`: **124**
  - `TRADE_LIMIT_BLOCK`: **22**

### Technical Findings from This Run

1. **T-31 baseline confirmed:** PRE_MARKET_SETUP callback crashed on symbol typing/normalization in this run. **V6.16 code fix applied; pending re-validation.**
2. **T-32 baseline confirmed:** intraday force-exit fallback exhibited close-side regression (`BUY` on close intent) in this run. **V6.16 router close-path fix applied; pending re-validation.**
3. **T-33 baseline confirmed:** approved->dropped instrumentation was opaque (`DROP_ROUTER_REJECT` without canonical cause). **V6.16 partial fix applied; pending re-validation.**
4. **T-11/T-12 behavior visible:** VIX spike and regime deterioration spread exits are firing, but not enough to protect losses when entries are poor.

### Optimization Findings from This Run

1. **O-13 confirmed:** PUT spread path is materially constrained by assignment gate strictness in stressed periods.
2. **O-14 confirmed:** participation remains primarily constrained by Micro gating, not slots.

## V6.15 Jul-Sep 2017 NoSync (Pre-Change Baseline Audit)

**Run:** `V6_15_Jul_Sep_2017_NoSync`

`docs/audits/logs/stage6.15/V6_15_Jul_Sep_2017_NoSync_orders.csv`  
`docs/audits/logs/stage6.15/V6_15_Jul_Sep_2017_NoSync_trades.csv`

**Date:** 2026-02-10

### Headline Metrics

- Trades: **38**
- Net P&L: **-$1,247**
- Calls: **35 trades**, **P&L +$1,657**
- Puts: **3 trades**, **P&L -$2,904**
- Micro funnel:
  - `MICRO_UPDATE=1,820`
  - `Dir=NONE=1,575` (**86.5%**)
  - `NO_TRADE=941`
  - `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_APPROVED=79`
  - `INTRADAY_RESULT=4`

### August Big-Loss RCA

- Largest August loss cluster is not market thesis failure alone; it is execution-path corruption:
  - 2017-08-22 15:30: `INTRADAY_FORCE_EXIT_FALLBACK` triggered for `170825C00144000`.
  - Close path submitted additional `BUY` and OCO recovery rebuilt with inflated quantity (`Qty=431`).
  - 2017-08-23 09:33: `RECON_ORPHAN_CLOSE_SUBMITTED` liquidated `Qty=653` at much lower price.
  - Result: stacked losses on same contract (`-4,180`, `-3,996`, `-4,218`) and large fallback loss.

### Additional Findings

1. **T-34 baseline confirmed:** close flow was not idempotent in force-close window and could amplify holdings. **V6.16 lock/idempotency fix applied; pending re-validation.**
2. **T-35 baseline confirmed:** OCO recovery ran during force-close and recovered quantity diverged from holdings. **V6.16 cutoff/guard fix applied; pending re-validation.**
3. VASS PUT path remains underrepresented:
   - `VASS_REJECTION=5` in this sample, all `ValidationFail=BEAR_PUT_ASSIGNMENT_GATE`
   - spread entries are almost entirely bullish debit (`BULL_CALL`).
4. Spread exits are firing (`REGIME_DETERIORATION`, `NEUTRALITY_EXIT`, `PROFIT_TARGET`, `STOP_LOSS`), but entry mix remains one-sided.

### Technical Validation Summary

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Direction mismatch | ✅ Validated | 396 approved-vs-selected comparisons, **0 mismatches** |
| OCO wiring | ✅ Validated | `OCO_CREATED=89`, `OCO_ACTIVATED=89`, `OCO_STOP=40`, `OCO_PROFIT=23` |
| Scheduler failures | ✅ Validated | No callback crash signatures in this run |
| Intraday overnight escape (DTE<=2) | ✅ Validated | No true intraday DTE<=2 carry escapes found |
| Margin reliability | 🔴 Open | `Insufficient buying power` errors = 88, `MARGIN_CB_SKIP` = 46 |
| Margin width regression | 🔴 Open | `ROUTER_MARGIN_WIDTH_INVALID` = 23 |
| Assignment containment | 🔴 Open | 2022-03-29 assignment flow still forced QQQ liquidation |

### Optimization Findings

| Area | Evidence | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Micro gating still strict | `INTRADAY blocked NO_TRADE=462` | 🔴 Open |
| NO_TRADE dominant reasons | `CONFIRMATION_FAIL=155`, `QQQ_FLAT=117`, `REGIME_NOT_TRADEABLE=100`, `VIX_STABLE_LOW_CONVICTION=41` | 🔴 Open |
| VASS construction friction | `VASS_REJECTION=575`, split: `DEBIT_ENTRY_VALIDATION_FAILED=292`, `CREDIT_ENTRY_VALIDATION_FAILED=283` | 🟡 Monitor |
| Direction profitability imbalance | CALL trades 85 with P&L **-22,926**, PUT trades 54 with P&L **-1,993** | 🔴 Open |

### Conclusion (V6.13_a)

Core technical plumbing has improved (direction consistency, OCO activation, scheduler stability), but two critical paths remain unresolved: margin handling regression (`ROUTER_MARGIN_WIDTH_INVALID`) and assignment containment leak. Optimization bottlenecks are now mostly concentrated in Micro NO_TRADE gating and VASS contract validation strictness.

### Aug 24-26 Crisis Response (VIX Spike)

**What Worked:**
```
2015-08-24 06:30:00 REGIME V5.3: SPIKE CAP ACTIVATED - VIX=28.0 5d change=46.4%
2015-08-25 10:00:00 VIX_SPIKE: 24.9 -> 43.7 (via UVXY)
2015-08-25 10:00:00 MICRO_UPDATE: Regime=CRASH | Dir=PUT
```
- Spike cap activated at VIX 28.0 (+46.4% 5d)
- CRASH mode correctly detected
- Protective puts triggered 3 times
- Overnight gap protection closed spread at 15:45

**What Failed:**
- Protective puts bought at panic highs expired worthless (-$4,749)
- Long calls from Aug 13 decayed to $0.01 (-$7,060)

### Technical Validation (Stage6.14)

| Area | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Pre-market ladder active | ✅ Working | `PREMARKET_VIX_LADDER=50`, `PREMARKET_LADDER_CALL_BLOCK=15` |
| Cross-blocking fix | ✅ Working | Intraday + spread entries coexist on same timestamps/days |
| OCO margin reject path | 🟡 Fix applied (pending validation) | Static + fallback force-close timing moved to config-driven 15:25 path |
| Intraday signal execution path | 🟡 Fix applied (pending validation) | Approved `micro_state` is now reused in entry signal path |
| VASS execution continuity | 🟡 Fix applied (pending validation) | Assignment grace window added before non-mandatory assignment exits |

### New / Reconfirmed Bugs from Stage6.14

| ID | Bug | Severity | Evidence |
|----|-----|:--------:|----------|
| T-27 | OCO sibling margin reject race at force-close | P0 | Repeating `Order Error`/`INVALID` pairs at 15:30 for stale OCO ids; timing mitigation applied |
| T-28 | Intraday approved signals dropped before order placement | P0 | `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_DROPPED=281` (72.99% of approved signals); single-update mitigation applied |
| T-29 | Assignment guard instantly liquidates every VASS spread | P0 | `SPREAD: POSITION_REGISTERED=23`, `ASSIGNMENT_RISK_EXIT=23`, `POSITION_REMOVED=23`; assignment grace applied |
| O-12 | CALL-side loss concentration persists | P1 | CALL bucket contributes nearly all net loss; stress CALL block applied |

---

## Executive Summary

Latest validated run (`V6_13_a`, Dec 2021-Mar 2022) confirms technical progress in direction consistency and OCO activation, but strategy performance remains poor with **-$48,371** net P&L and **43.57%** win rate.  
Primary unresolved technical risks are **margin submit regression** and **assignment containment leak**. Primary optimization blockers remain **high Micro NO_TRADE gating**, **high VASS contract rejection**, and **CALL-side loss concentration**.

## Performance Snapshot

**All trades**
- Total trades: **140**
- Win%: **43.57%** (61 wins / 79 losses)
- Net P&L: **-48,371**

**By direction**
- Calls: **85 trades**, **P&L -22,926**
- Puts: **54 trades**, **P&L -1,993**

**Underlying assignments**
- `QQQ` equity liquidation event: **1** (2022-03-29 assignment containment leak)

---

## Order Mix

- Total orders: **425**
- Filled orders: **284**
- Invalid orders: **48**
- Canceled orders: **93**

**Observation:** Failure rate remains high (`(48 + 93) / 425 = 33.2%`), indicating reliability issues despite improved instrumentation.

---

## Signal → Execution Metrics

- `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_APPROVED`: **396**
- `INTRADAY blocked NO_TRADE`: **462**
- Top NO_TRADE reasons: `CONFIRMATION_FAIL=155`, `QQQ_FLAT=117`, `REGIME_NOT_TRADEABLE=100`, `VIX_STABLE_LOW_CONVICTION=41`

**Observation:** Approval and block reasons are now visible, but gating remains strict and materially limits participation.

---

## VASS Activity

- `VASS_REJECTION`: **575**
- `VASS_ENTRY`: **40**
- Rejection split: `DEBIT_ENTRY_VALIDATION_FAILED=292`, `CREDIT_ENTRY_VALIDATION_FAILED=283`

**Observation:** VASS now enters more often than prior runs, but validation rejects are still dominant.

---

## Assignment Prevention

- `ASSIGNMENT_RISK_EXIT`: present
- `PREMARKET_ITM` checks: present
- `QQQ` equity liquidation event: **1** (2022-03-29)

**Conclusion:** Assignment safeguards improved but are not yet airtight.

---

## Major Issues (Ranked)

**P1 — Low Win Rate + Negative P&L**
   - Calls remain the largest loss bucket (**-22.9k**).
   - Net result stays deeply negative despite technical fixes.

**P1 — Micro gating remains strict**
   - `NO_TRADE` and confirmation checks are still blocking a large share of opportunities.

**P1 — VASS validation friction**
   - Debit and credit validations both reject at high volume (292/283).

**P0 — Margin/assignment reliability**
   - `ROUTER_MARGIN_WIDTH_INVALID` and one assignment containment leak remain unresolved technical risks.

---

## What Improved vs V6.9

✅ **Direction mismatch fixed** (approved vs selected direction mismatch = 0)  
✅ **OCO wiring active** (`OCO_CREATED=89`, `OCO_ACTIVATED=89`)  
✅ **Scheduler callback stability improved** (no legacy PRE_MARKET_SETUP crash in this run)  

---

## Fixes Applied (Pending Validation)

- **V6.13 optimization tuning (config-only)**:
  - Micro participation: lowered noise/fallback thresholds (`QQQ_NOISE_THRESHOLD`, `INTRADAY_QQQ_FALLBACK_MIN_MOVE`, `MICRO_SCORE_*_CONFIRM`, `INTRADAY_DEBIT_FADE_VIX_MIN`, `INTRADAY_FADE_MIN_MOVE`, `INTRADAY_ITM_MIN_*`).
  - Loss control: tightened ITM stop/target and ATR base/floor (`INTRADAY_ITM_STOP`, `INTRADAY_ITM_TARGET`, `OPTIONS_ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER`, `OPTIONS_ATR_STOP_MIN_PCT`).
  - VASS constructability: widened credit short-leg delta max and reduced spread width target/min (`CREDIT_SPREAD_SHORT_LEG_DELTA_MAX`, `SPREAD_WIDTH_MIN`, `SPREAD_WIDTH_TARGET`).
  - Choppy recycling: re-enabled tight neutrality exit (`SPREAD_NEUTRALITY_EXIT_*`).
- **VASS spread failure cooldown trap**: Added DTE fallback ranges and only apply cooldown after all ranges fail.
- **VASS rejection visibility**: Added compact `FailStats` summary to throttled `VASS_REJECTION` logs.
- **Swing/Intraday cross‑blocking**: Replaced `has_position()` gate with mode‑specific `can_enter_swing()` and `has_intraday_position()` checks.
- **Micro Dir=None reduction**: Lowered `QQQ_NOISE_THRESHOLD` (0.35→0.25), `INTRADAY_QQQ_FALLBACK_MIN_MOVE` (0.50→0.35), `MICRO_SCORE_*_CONFIRM` (52/48→50/50), and `INTRADAY_ITM_MIN_MOVE` (0.80→0.45).
- **CALL bias control**: Asymmetric UVXY conviction thresholds (CALL -5%, PUT +2.5%) and NEUTRAL aligned trades allowed at reduced size.
- **Micro NO_TRADE visibility**: Throttled `MICRO_NO_TRADE` logs added with VIX/QQQ move + score.
- **Order tagging**: Options orders tagged as `MICRO` (intraday) or `VASS` (swing) in router for web/log clarity.
- **VASS credit selection fix**: Candidate contracts now filtered by strategy-required option right (CALL/PUT), not macro direction.
- **VASS_ENTRY logging**: Added explicit `VASS_ENTRY` log on spread signal creation.
- **Signal→execution visibility**: Added `INTRADAY_SIGNAL_DROPPED` log for approved signals that fail to produce orders.
- **Overnight gap protection (swing)**: Added EOD VIX-based close for spreads (all days).
- **VIX spike auto-exit (spreads)**: Exit bullish spreads on VIX level/5D spike.
- **Regime deterioration exit (spreads)**: Exit on regime drop/rise vs entry score.
- **Monthly P&L tracking (O-10)**: New `MonthlyPnLTracker` class in `utils/monthly_pnl_tracker.py`. Tracks P&L by engine (TREND, MR, OPT, HEDGE, YIELD) and month. Integrated into `main.py` for all fill handlers (TREND exits, MR exits, intraday options, spread closes). Persisted via ObjectStore. Logs EOD summary with win rate and net P&L.

---

## What Still Needs Fixing

1. **Close approved->dropped leak first (P0)**  
   - Eliminate generic `DROP_ENGINE_NO_SIGNAL` dominance with explicit engine/router reason propagation.
2. **Make intraday rejection telemetry backtest-visible (P0)**  
   - Ensure gate/validation failures are visible without requiring `LiveMode`.
3. **Reduce Dir=NONE without breaking bull participation (P1)**  
   - Tune conviction/noise thresholds with regime-conditional sizing, not blanket loosening.
4. **Improve VASS constructability and entry mix (P1)**  
   - Continue targeted filter tuning by dominant rejection class (DTE/delta/liquidity), avoid global over-relaxation.
5. **Control CALL losses in bear stress while preserving bull capture (P1)**  
   - Keep conditional CALL gates active and verify trigger rates in logs.

---

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Lower VASS rejection rate**
   - Re‑examine delta bounds vs market data in 2022.
2. **Tighten intraday execution pipeline**
   - Add explicit logging for approval→submit→fill to trace drop‑offs.
3. **Audit CALL strategy**
   - Losses are concentrated in CALLs; check for wrong regime usage or stop/target scaling.

---

## Optimization Fix List (Summary)

**Execution & Pipeline**
- Add explicit log markers at: signal approved → order submit → fill → register.
- Track “approved but not submitted” reasons (margin pre‑check, cooldown, time window).

**Micro Signal Quality**
- Further reduce `Dir=NONE` by narrowing VIX‑stable band or adding a secondary QQQ fallback for low‑VIX days.
- Add a minimum conviction threshold that scales with VIX (lower in low‑VIX regimes).

**VASS Construction**
- Instrument rejection reasons by category (delta, DTE, credit, liquidity) and log counts.
- Relax delta/DTE only for the **rejection-dominant category**, not globally.

**Strategy Profitability**
- Review CALL losses by regime; disable CALLs in CAUTIOUS/DEFENSIVE unless macro+micro align.
- Re‑test stop/target symmetry for CALLs only; keep PUT logic unchanged if it is less negative.

**Assignment & Risk**
- Keep DTE=1 force‑close and pre‑market ITM check (working).
- Add a pre‑entry assignment buffer check for **all** spreads (not just on exit).
